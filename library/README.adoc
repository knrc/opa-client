# OPA Client

Client intended to work with an OPA server over HTTP(S), or locally be executing
policy rules in wasm modules.

The motivation for using OPA's ability to compile policies into wasm is that the
same wasm policy can be used with Rust, Node.js, (and other wasm runtimes), and
at the same wasm module can be used in a OPA server running somewhere as part of
a CI/CD pipeline, or in a Kubernetes gatekeeper.


## Policy Querying

Initial work is towards policy querying (using the *Data API*), not policy or document management within an OPA server.

## Building

Currently integration tests use (a fork of) `testcontainers` crate, which requires Docker or Podman to be running.
The setup as it stands today is through using Unix domain sockets.
If using some non-default socket location, `DOCKER_SOCKET` environment variable should be set, pointing to the control endpoint for Docker or Podman.
For podman on Linux this can be configured by running the
